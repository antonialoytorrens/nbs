About:
------
  This is a patch to Stella which allows it to use SDL for graphics and
  input.  (Currently, sound is still handled by the existing "SndUnix" stuff)

  The SDL patch includes an option to display the screen rotated sideways,
  in a 240x320 window.  Perfect for PDAs (like the Sharp Zaurus).

  (Get SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/ )


  This will be deprecated soon, hopefully!  (See Stella CVS / 1.2 version)


How to apply it:
----------------

1. get the source for Stella.
   http://stella.atari.org/

2. "mkdir stella-1.1/src/ui/sdl/"

3. put "mainSDL.cxx" in that directory

4. backup stella-1.1/src/build/makefile  (eg, rename it to "makefile-orig")

5. put "makefile" in the 'build' directory


How to compile:
---------------
* run "make sdl" to make the SDL target for the host system (240x320 sideways
  is default, thanks to "#define SIDEWAYS" in "mainSDL.cxx")

* run "make zaurus" to try to build SDL target for ARM
  It currently fails.  HELP!!! :)


How to run
----------
* Turn off keyclicks (using speaker icon on Zaurus' taskbar)

* Execute the program (e.g., "./zstella 2600-roms/GAME.ROM") from the Terminal

* Push [R] key for 'Reset' (eg, to begin a game)
* Push [S] key for 'Select' (eg, change level/mode/no.players/etc.)

* Push [C] to set color switch to 'Color'
* Push [B] to set color switch to 'Black-and-White'

* Push [1] or [2] to set player 1's difficulty to 'A' or 'B'  (eg, Fn+Q, Fn+W)
* Push [3] or [4] to set player 2's difficulty to 'A' or 'B'  (eg, FN+E, Fn+R)

* Use the directional pad as the joystick
* Use the selector button (in the middle of the d-pad) for joystick firebutton

* Use the stylus to simulate paddle  (tap is firebutton - not very good :^( )

* Push [X] to exit  ('Cancel' doesn't work - not sure why!)


Results
-------
I've tested with Adventure, Kaboom!, Pole Position, Video Pinball,
Entombed, 


To Do
-----
This port won't really go anywhere.  Stella is being ported to SDL for
version 1.2.  I'm working with the porter and Stella's main author
to get it to work on the Zaurus.  (Hi guys!  Feel free to swipe my code!)


Here's the obvious list of what needs to be done:

* Sound  [ will be SDL-based ]

* Qt-based launcher front-end  [ base on Kstella? ]

* Add ".bin" 2600 cart. mime-type to Zaurus, with icon
  [ see 'zstella-cart.png' ]

* On-screen switch controls  [ see '2600console.bmp' ]

* Better paddle  [ support some key for paddle trigger, instead of
                   MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event (tapping and dragging) ]

* 270 degree rotation  [ for people who want to play the OTHER sideways ]



HAVE FUN!
