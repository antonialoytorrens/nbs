Welcome to New Breed Software's Mad Bomber Download Area.

Mad Bomber is a clone of Activision's 1981 Atari 2600 classic, "Kaboom!".
It uses SDL, so it can be run under Linux, Windows 32-bit, UNIX and BeOS.
See http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/ for more info on SDL.

Linux users and people interested in cross-compiling it for other OSes by
hand should grab the ".tar.gz" file.

Win32 users should grab the "-win32.zip" file.
