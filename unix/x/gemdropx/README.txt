A direct port of the original Atari 8-bit computer game, "Gem Drop" by the
same author.

Similar to games like Klax and Jewels, and once compared to "Tetris meets
Space Invaders."  Grab gems from the top and throw them back to make matches.
Don't let the screen fill up.

Includes wonderful rendered graphics by Bernhard Trummer as well as some nice
drawn and digitzed graphics.

Play with the keyboard, a mouse or a joystick.  Requires Sam Lantinga's
"Simple DirectMedia Layer" (SDL) library.  Optionally uses the SDL mixer
library for sound and music.  (Version 0.6 uses Xlib for graphics.)
