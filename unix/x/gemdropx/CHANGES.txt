Gem Drop X CHANGES
------------------

Changes since v.0.8:
  * Doesn't abort if it can't play sound.
  * Sound device opened at 44,100Hz instead of 11,025Hz (sounds better!)

Changes since v.0.7:

  * Keyrepeat support put back (thanks to new SDL functions)
  * Added calls to SDL_Quit()
  * Joystick support converted to SDL code
  * Changed references to "mixer" to "SDL_mixer" (its new name)

Changes since v.0.6:

  * Removed Xlib code and replaced it with SDL.  (Lots of .c and .h files
    removed.)
  * Renamed documentation to have ".txt" extensions.
  * PPM files converted to BMP (since SDL loads them natively).
  * License changed to GPL.
  * Compile-time options reconfigured (defaults to use sound and joystick).
  * Command line options now in the form of "--option".
  * Fixed a mouse movement control bug.
  * Made level 14 a little easier.

Changes since v.0.5:

  * Fixed call to "Mix_PlayChannel()" to use the new SDL mixer API.
  * Commented out calls to "Mix_Volume...()", since in SDL 0.10.0, calling
    them screws up the audio. <:^(
  * Patch from Matthew Rice <matt@starnix.com> to let you compile joystick
    support in, but not _need_ a joystick plugged in to play.

Changes since v.0.4:

  * Game timing and difficulty was tweaked slightly.
  * Gem-addition function corrected (it was adding blank spaces... the original
    did not do this!)
  * Graphics were redone, with most contributed by Bernhard Trummer.
  * Graphic image sizes enlarged from 32x32 pixels to 48x48 pixels.
  * Linux joystick support added.
  * Sound routines switch to using SDL.
  * Sound effects changed.
  * Lots of compiler warnings fixed.
  * Source moved into a "src/" subdirectory.
  * Objects moved into an "obj/" subdirectory.
  * Useful defaults put into "makefile" (most people can compile with just
    "make").
  * Documentation split up and cleaned up.
  * Mouse pointer changes to represent mouse controls available at that spot.
  * Most of the original Atari 8-bit Action! source is now included (see the
    "action/" subdirectory).

Changes since v.0.3:

  * Full color!
  * Better makefile / installation procedure
  * Less CPU usage
  * Timing closer to the original Gem Drop
  * A little "you've gotten to level 15" animation
    (like the original Gem Drop)

Changes since v.0.2:

  * Sound!!!

Changes since v.0.1:

  * Mouse controls work better.  Clicking ON the man no longer moves him.
  * Extra key controls added.  [A]/[Z] to throw/grab.  [K]/[L] to move.
  * A "warning" graphic replaces the bomb icon to warn you when new gems
    are about to appear.
  * A cool "brick wall" graphic replaces the plain white wall graphic
    when the game is over.
  * "-version" and "-help" switches added to the application.
  * A spiffy title screen!
  * You can now pause with [P] or [Space]
