This area contains the source-code for Tux Paint, and in some cases,
the source to (or patches for) various libraries required by Tux Paint.

"tuxpaint-#.#.#.tar.gz" is the source code to Tux Paint itself, and
generally what the compiled builds for various platforms (e.g., Windows,
Debian Linux, BeOS, etc.) are based directly on.
