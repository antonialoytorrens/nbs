This area contains the source-code for Tux Paint Config, the FTLK-based
graphical tool for managing Tux Paint's configuration file.

"tuxpaint-config-#.#.#.tar.gz" is the source code to Tux Paint Config, and
generally what the compiled builds for various platforms (e.g., Windows,
Debian Linux, BeOS, etc.) are based directly on.
