This directory contains Portable Application Description (PAD) files describing
various versions of Tux Paint.  These files are often used by software
directories.  An example situation is: a new version of Tux Paint is released,
and someone (e.g. Bill Kendrick) visits some software directory websites to
get the new version of Tux Paint listed there.  Some sites accept PAD files,
which are easier to submit than hand-entering data into web forms over and
over again.

Here's a random page found via Google that describes PAD files:
