This is an FTP area containing Tux Paint, a drawing program for young
children.

In most cases, this is a kind of mirror of what's available from the
Tux Paint project at SourceForge.
( http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tuxpaint/ )

In some cases, it contains test files, bits of source that are useful
to developers, etc.  See each directory (and its corresponding README.txt)
for details.

Email me (or post to the tuxpaint-devel mailing list) if you have any
questions.  See the Tux Paint website for much more information.
