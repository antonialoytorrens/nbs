This area contains test builds (and possibly other useful downloads)
of Tux Paint.  For example, source tarballs based on a CVS snapshot,
builds for Win32 for testing bug fixes or urgently-needed features, etc.

THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE TEMPORARY!  Their existence is typically
posted on the 'tuxpaint-devel' mailing list (and are often due to conversations
and developer- and packager-coordination there).

(See: http://www.tuxpaint.org/lists/ for information on mailing lists.)

Use at your own risk!
