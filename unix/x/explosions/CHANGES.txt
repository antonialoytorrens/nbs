CHANGES for Explosions Demo

July 31, 2005
  (Hey, it's been 4 years!)
  * Doesn't insist on 16bpp, and therefore doesn't convert to/from 16bpp
    if the screen's natural depth is something else (e.g., 24bpp)
  * Blur effect made less precise, and therefore a little faster.

October 6, 2001
  * Added call to SDL_Quit() (oops!)

August 5, 2001
  * Blur effect added.
  * Dissolve effect added.
  * Heat (fire/flame) effect added.
  * More comments added.
  * Quits on SDL_QUIT event (eg, window 'close' button clicked)

August 3, 2001
  * Rotation effect added.
  * Fade effect separated from zoom effect. (All 3 can be in any on/off combo.)
  * Effects can be toggled on/off during execution (no more #defines)
  * Effects now controlled with keyboard, not mouse
  * Added "--help", "--version" commandlines and usage error

August 2, 2001
