0.0.6 - April 20, 2002
----------------------
  * Fixed "Ugh" and "Ouch" sounds for embedded version.

  * Added 'Start' and 'Continue' buttons to embedded title screen.

  * Game pauses when you press Escape (Cancel) in embedded version.

  * Game state saved when you quit, loaded when you start again, so you can
    unpause even if you've quit the game completely!

  * Splatted bugs eventually vanish in embedded version.

  * Embedded version uses hidden file (~/.bugsquish) for high score, instead
    of a visible one (~/bugsquish.dat)

  * Embedded version uses mouse motion, not mouse button press.
    (Too easy to not lift stylus high enough.)


0.0.5 - April 19, 2002
----------------------
  * Created embedded version.


0.0.4 - November 12, 2001
-------------------------
  * Added name of "Blood Suckers"' author to documentation
    (Brian Greenstone of Pangea Software).

  * Alpha channel in PNGs now used, so there's less white artifacting around
    the bugs and power-ups.

  * Added a new bug-type: Pill bugs.

  * Updated and corrected INSTALL.txt documentation.


0.0.3 - December 14, 2000
-------------------------
  * Added Windows target.


0.0.2 - May 21, 2000
--------------------
  * Replaced BMP images with PNG images, greatly reducing their size.
    Hence, Bug Squish now requires the SDL_Image library.

  * Now uses SDL's accellerated RLE blitting for colorkeyed images.

  * Stress warning added to program.

  * Replaced the woman's voice saying "ahh" with my own voice, which makes
    MUCH more sense, since it's my arm in the game and the other sounds
    are male, too. :)


0.0.1 - April 9, 2000
---------------------
  * High score added.

  * Data file added (high score and high wave saved, as well as final score
    and wave from the last game).

  * You can quit the "New Breed Software Presents" intro. screen early by
    clicking the mouse or pressing a key.
