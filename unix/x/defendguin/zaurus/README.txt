Subject: Re: NBS Feedback - Defendguin - tar.gz on its way
To: Bill Kendrick <nbs@sonic.net>

Hello Bill,

Many thanks for the swift (and enthusiastic !) response. My next message
will include a attachement of the compiled version of defendguin for
ethe Zaurus C760/C860. It should work on the new C3000 as well, although
I don't know anyone with one to test it. The file is 2347066 bytes in
size and has the following md5 check sum:-

defendguin-0.0.10_zaurus_c860.tar.gz 5cc15ee49a5f31f4ca591ef2d61d4e4b

To run:
1) copy the tar.gz file into a directory on the Sharp zaurus.
2) Use the commands "gunzip defenguin-0.0.10_zaurus_c860.tar.gz" then
run " tar -xvf defenguin-0.0.10_zaurus_c860.tar"
3) cd into the directory defendguin-0.0.10 (cd defendguin-0.0.10)
4) Run the arm binary using the command "./defendguin"

It should all start up - music and everything if you have the SDL-mixer
package installed (which I do - 1.2.6-zports-0 of libSDL mixer, and
libSDL itself of course.
