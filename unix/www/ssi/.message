Welcome to New Breed Software's Web Server Side Includes Area

These programs are meant to be ran via Server Side Include (SSI) calls
in HTML pages on your webserver.

Download the "makefile" to compile any or all of these simple C scripts.
Note: You'll probably want to download these via an FTP client while
telnet'ed into your server.

Jot down this directory's address ( ftp.sonic.net:/pub/users/nbs/unix/www/ssi )
and fire up your server's FTP client.
