2002.03.07
  * Inverted colors (white on black) for host and ARM targets. (-DINVERSE)
  * Added Makefile target to build for ARM processor (eg, iPaq or Zaurus
    running Linux and X-Window) ("make arm") - including support for the
    larger screen (-DQUARTER_VGA).

2001.10.09
  * Slow ship rotation (12dpf (degrees per frame) now, instead of 16dpf)
  * High score (displayed on title screen)
  * Extra lives (every 10,000 points)
  * Compile-time option to set button mode to 'alternative' by default.
    Used when building for host (desktop).  ("REAL_KEYBOARD" #defined)
  * Updated documentation (README.txt)
  * Pause/continue implemented
  * Paused game stored to disk, so you can quit, run later, and unpause
  * Ship's momentum slows (unrealistic, but like the original, and reduces
    difficulty of control)

2001.10.05
  * Added "input" windowmanager hint and title, so program will appear in
    VRSM window lists (VR->Windows menu, and Statusbar app windowlist).
    This works around a current bug in VRSM.
  * Documentation updates.
  * Returns bell pitch/duration back after quitting.
  * Ship thrust implemented!!!
  * Manual ship respawn override (press Shift)

  * Levels
  * Bullets made bigger
  * Sound on/off toggle added (lower right corner)
  * Displays score from last play on title screen
  * Game ends when ships run out
  * Changed default button controls; old controls now selectable "Alternative"

2001.05.25
  * Added vector-based text-drawing capabilities
  * Removed shading behind status area (not really useful on LCD)
  * Entire screen cleared instead of just objects (simplifies things)
  * Score display made thicker
  * Lines in shapes wrap around (so popup doesn't happen on edges as much)
  * Started work on the title screen
  * Added a tappable "X" on the screen to quit the game
  * Bullets made thicker
  * XPM icon updated

2001.05.22
