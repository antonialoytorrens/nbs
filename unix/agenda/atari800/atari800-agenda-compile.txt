Compiling Atari 800 for Agenda

First, be sure you have the mipsel-linux compiler and headers installed,
as well as the Agenda/MIPS X11R6 libraries installed (I assume they're
in "/usr/mipsel-linux/lib/X11/"... it may be different for you.)

Download Atari800 source (tar.gz or via CVS) from http://joy.sophics.cz/a800/

Apply the diffs to fix the "refresh rate" bug and add a "-tiny" window
mode.


1. Begin building for your host... this will cause the configuration program
   to start up and ask you some questions:

$ cd Atari800/src
$ cp Makefile.unix Makefile
$ make x11

  computer very slow?     Y
  snailmeter?             N
  realtime process?       N
  joystick?               N
  sound?                  N
  volume only?            N
  sound interpolation?    N
  sound clipping?         N
  stereo?                 N
  BREAK command?          N
  hints in disassembler?  N
  assembler in monitor?   N
  crash menu?             N
  compressed state files? N
  internal palettes?      N

Press CONTROL-C quickly after configure done (once compiling begins)


2. Delete any .o files which you saw get built before you had the chance
   to stop the build with CONTROL-C.


3. Delete the "prompts.o" object so it can be rebuilt for MIPS


4. Alter the Makefile so that it uses your MIPS X11 libraries, instead
   of your host's:
   
   $ sed 's_LIBS="-L/usr/X11/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib $(LIBS) -lX11"_LIBS="-L/usr/mipsel-linux/lib/X11 $(LIBS) -lX11 -lm"_' Makefile > Makefile.new

   $ mv Makefile Makefile.old
   $ mv Makefile.new Makefile


5. Source changes:

   * In "atari_x11.c", comment out the lines that call "XAutoRepeatOff" and
     "XAutoRepeatOn".


5. Build the program!

   $ make x11 CC=mipsel-linux-gcc
   $ mipsel-linux-strip atari800
   $ mipsel-linux-strip --remove-section .compact_rel atari800
   $ mipsel-linux-strip --remove-section .note atari800
   $ mipsel-linux-strip --remove-section .comment atari800


6. Did it work?

   $ file atari800

   You should see something like:

     atari800: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS R3000_BE - invalid byte order,
     version 1, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped


7. Grab ROMs

   Download PC Xformer for DOS to get the legal copies of the original
   Atari 8-bit OS and BASIC ROMs.  http://www.emulators.com/


8. Upload

   $ rsync atari800 *.ROM agenda::vr3/home/default/


9. Run "atari800 -small" on your Agenda, from a terminal.

   Answer the questions regarding location of your ROMs.
   Set "refresh rate" to something high, like 10.
   For the rest of the questions, you can accept the defaults.
   Once you've done this, you'll have an "atari800.cfg" file in the
   current directory, and you won't be asked these questions again.
