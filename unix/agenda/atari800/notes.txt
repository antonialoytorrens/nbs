You're right. -refresh 10 should result in only every 10th frame to be
displayed. In addition, unfortunately, for most systems also only every
10th time ANTIC display generation is executed but you can correct that
easily by moving the first ANTIC_RunDisplayList() call in atari.c up a
few lines right between the #ifndef BASIC and the #ifndef SVGA_SPEEDUP

Hi,

That means, the IOCTL for setting fragments in the Linux
Sound driver fails. If I remember right, fragments were used
to split the sound buffer of the sound driver, to make the
audio delay smaller. Seems your sound driver did not support
this or teh parameters must be set differently.
You can at first ignore this error and live with a (possible)
higher audio delay.

Unfortunately /dev/dsp handler currently refuses to work if cannot set
fragments. 
What sound card/driver you use? Does it support getospace? 
If so then it would be possible to make sound handler more forgiving.

Hi William,

what about diff -u -r original_tree your_working_copy ?

within one day is OK?

No. If you read through the CHANGES file you'll find there some remarks
about new refresh system that allows you to listen to music while the
screen is refreshed just 1/4, IIRC.

The Makefiles are messy. I welcome any help with improving them.

sounds good :)
