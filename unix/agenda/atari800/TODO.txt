* Speed it up!
  * Fewer frames per second
  * Reduce internal color palette to 16 greys
* Sound
  * Need to update my Agenda to support sound :)
* Fix display
  * Average pixels, rather than skip them
  * Remove window border
* Controls
  * Build launcher (being worked on; FLTK-based)
  * Add clickable buttons for Start/Select/Option/Reset/Break/Inverse
  * Display alternate (Atari 8-bit style) on-screen keyboard!
