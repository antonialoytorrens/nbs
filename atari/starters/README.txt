Atari 8-bit "starters"

This directory contains things to get a real Atari
(with a floppy disk!) working with some of the software
found here, especially when using the ARC archive versions
(rather than ATR disk images).

mydos453.dcm -- MyDOS 4.53/4 in a DiskCommunicator disk
image file (DCM).

mydos453.atr -- MyDOS 4.53/4 in an ATR disk image file
(used with emulators, and virtual drive devices, like
SIO2PC and SDriveMax).

supunarc.com -- SuperUnARC -- unarcs ARC files.
Load this from DOS.

dskcom32.arc -- DiskCommunicator 3.2.  Reads a DCM file
and writes the results to a floppy disk.  You'll need to
unARC it first (e.g., using "SuperUnARC").

tbasici.arc -- TurboBASIC XL interpreter.  You'll need to
unARC it first (e.g., using "SuperUnARC").


These files have been here for ages, but I finally added
this README.txt in Oct. 2020.
