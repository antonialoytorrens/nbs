Atari 8-bit demos by Bill Kendrick / New Breed Software

October 17, 2020

Most of what's here has been here, in ARC archive format,
for many decades.  In Oct. 2020, I decided to create
bootable ATR disk images for each.  In most cases, things
are not particularly modified -- the ATR simply includes
MyDOS, and boots directly into the demo (if binary),
or into TurboBASIC XL or the compiled-TBLX runtime,
which then loads the program automatically.

Note that in some cases, there may be documentation
(TXT files), so you may wish to dig around the disk image
(e.g., "[A] Disk Directory" from MyDOS) and read the file
("[C] Copy File(s)", "D:FILENAME.TXT,E:" -- use [Ctrl]+[1]
to pause/unpause if it scrolls by too quickly).

Enjoy
